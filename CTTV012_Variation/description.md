#Evidence.variant2trait.association_score

Each json record in this dataset contains a unique variant to trait assocation. Thus the log-likilhood for all variant 2 trait associations is the same value: TBC

Calculated via:
(total number of json records that share variant 2 trait association) / (total number of unique variants * total number of unique traits)
= (1) / (TBC * 34539)
= TBC

#Evidence.variant2gene.association_score

To assign variants to genes we use a pipeline built by Michael Maguire(mmaguire@ebi.ac.uk).

For each of the variant RS ids the pipeline will get :
* the [REST API JSON output](http://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/vep_id_post)
* the nearest gene output from the Ensembl Perl API (the get_nearest_Gene() method from the Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::VariationFeature
package in the [Ensembl Variation api](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/variation/index.html#api)).
* the online [VEP](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) output .

Those outputs are loaded into a database.

For non intergenic genes :
The pipeline first interrogates the REST API JSON and uses the JSON property "most_serious_consequence" to extract information
for transcripts that have the same "consequence" property value as this. These values use Sequence Ontology terms (SO terms) like
"missense_variant","stop_gained"...
If the variant SO term indicates it is non-synonymous ("missense_variant") for one or more genes or in a 5'- or 3'-UTR,
it is assigned to those genes no more checks are run.
Then, if the variant SO term indicates it is intronic for one or more genes, it is assigned to those genes.

For intergenic genes:
The pipeline uses the Perl API nearest gene method and the variant is assigned to the nearest gene at the 5'
end. As there is no SO term to describe that the pipeline uses the following term nearest_gene_five_prime_end (http://targetvalidation.org/sequence/nearest_gene_five_prime_end).

Finally, the REST VEP API does not report regulatory SNPs (or didn't when the platform was implemented). This information
is obtained from the on-line VEP tool. If a SNP is flagged as regulatory, the pipeline assign it as such using the relvant SO term and
over-write any previous assignment.

In the end we obtain a file like containing the information below :

| gwas_snp_rs_id | assigned_ensembl_gene_id | sequence_ontology_term | overlapping_ensembl_gene_ids |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------
| rs227724 | ENSG00000183691|upstream_gene_variant|_ |
| rs2488389|ENSG00000213047|intron_variant|_ |
| rs7200543|ENSG00000275498|synonymous_variant | ENSG00000179889 |

To obtain a score we associate the returned SO terms with a number between 0 and 1 which reflect the severity of the effect
of the snp on the given gene (the closer to 1 and most severe). It also reflects in some degree the likeliness of that snp
to be associated with that gene.
If the snp is in a coding region of a gene and brings a new stop codon it is likely that the snp to gene assignment is right.
If the gene is associated to a snp because it was the nearest gene to this snp, the association can still be right but we're less
sure of it then in the previous example.

#Evidence.gene2triat.association_score

This score is the adjusted binary log-likelihood value for the given gene to trait association.

In each case, the total number of json records that share the same gene to trait association across this dataset was divided by the matrix of possible gene to trait associations:
(total number of json records that share gene to triat association) / (total number of unique genes * total number of unique traits)

The resulting values were adjusted to account for the confidence of each recording of each variant 2 gene association. 
Each recording of each gene to trait association is attributed a value of 0-4 from the original ClinVar record which indicates the confidence associated (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/review_guidelines/):
0 - conflict
1 - single submitter
2 - multiple submitters
3 - expert panel
4 - practice guidline
(There is no representation of a "0" confidence score in our data)

To account fo the fact that gene to triat associations that are supported by confidence values of "1", or multiple recordings of "1"s, are weaker than all others a downregulating factor of TBC was used.
Our downregulation factor ensures that the adjusted binary log-likelihood value for gene to trait relationship supported by "1", or multiple of "1"s, is smaller than the lowest adjusted binary log-likelihood value for a gene to trait relationship supported by at least one confidence value greater than 1.
